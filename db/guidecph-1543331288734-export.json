Each room was dedicated to different spiritual practices and they got the last room, painted already in Tibetan colours, so they just put up some thankas, showed some pictures on slides and guided meditations. Here they also noticed a hindu guru guiding meditations in English and got the idea to translate our meditations to Danish first. A man coming to this exhibition offered them the basement of his building around the corner for free to meet in regular basis. This came to be the first dimondway buddhist center in the West. ",

When 16th Karmapa visited them there in 1974, he insisted that they should find a new place. Three days after he left Denmark, the building overflowed with waste waters and it was clear what to do.
